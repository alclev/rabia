# RABIA

RABIA is a consensus algorithm designed to achieve consensus in distributed systems efficiently and robustly. This implementation provides a practical reference for understanding and utilizing the RABIA algorithm.

## Overview

RABIA is a consensus protocol that ensures fault tolerance and consistency in distributed systems. It is designed to handle arbitrary node failures and network partitions while maintaining high performance and low latency.

## Features

- **Fault Tolerance:** Capable of withstanding node failures and network partitions.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for low latency and high throughput.
- **Scalability:** Supports a large number of nodes in a distributed network.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the RABIA implementation, you need the following installed on your system:

- c++

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
